# StudentRecords
This project creates a school class with a user defined number of Student objects. 
Once the number of students is decided upon, the user inputs deatils including the student's name, number of classes, and which subjects they take.
The user can then enter the students indivual grades for each of their subjects.
The program then prints out a Grade Point Average (GPA) for each student based on their average result.
